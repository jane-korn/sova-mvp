Complete your ABN Registration (it's free and takes 15 minutes), then use a Business Structure Guide to choose between sole trader, partnership, or company. Don't skip public liability insurance ($500-$2k/year) or your domain name registration (.com.au requires an ABN). If you're working with others, budget for a shareholders agreement ($1,500-$5,000), it prevents expensive conflicts later. Get professional advice from Accountants and Lawyers, as this decision affects your tax and liability forever, and changing structures is more costly than paying a professional to complete your business set up.
