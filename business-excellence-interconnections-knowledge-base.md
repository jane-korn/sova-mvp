## Executive Summary

This knowledge base documents how the nine Sova business excellence elements (Governance, Purpose, Strategy, Marketing, Finance, Performance, People, Process, Technology) interconnect and influence each other, based on research from global frameworks including Baldrige, ISO 9001, and EFQM.

**Key Principles:**
- All elements are interconnected and interdependent
- Symptoms in one element often have root causes in multiple other elements
- Understanding the hierarchy and flow between elements is critical for effective diagnosis
- Effective root cause analysis requires systematic questioning across element boundaries

## Global Framework Foundations

### 1. Baldrige Excellence Framework

**Systems Perspective:**
The Baldrige Excellence Framework emphasises a comprehensive systems-based approach where "managing all the parts of your organisation as a unified whole to achieve your mission and strive toward your vision" is fundamental ([NIST Baldrige](https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about-baldrige-excellence-framework)).

**Seven Interconnected Categories:**
1. Leadership
2. Strategy
3. Customers
4. Measurement, Analysis, and Knowledge Management
5. Workforce
6. Operations
7. Results

**Critical Integration Points:**
- The word "integration" at the centre of the Baldrige model shows that all elements are interrelated
- The leadership triad (Leadership, Strategy, Customers) drives the results triad (Workforce, Operations, Results)
- Central relationship exists between Leadership and Results categories
- Excellence is demonstrated through outstanding results achieved via integrated systems ([Baldrige Framework 2017-2018](https://business-excellent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2017-2018_Baldrige_Excellence_Framework_Business_Nonprofit.pdf))

**Performance Relationships:**
"Leadership drives the system which creates results" - this recursive relationship means all categories are related and interconnected ([Kainexus](https://blog.kainexus.com/improvement-disciplines/baldrige-award/the-journey-toward-performance-excellence)).

**Organisational Diagnosis:**
The Baldrige Framework serves to help organisations "assess their improvement efforts, diagnose their overall performance management system, and identify their strengths and opportunities for improvement" ([Hype Innovation](https://www.hypeinnovation.com/blog/the-baldrige-framework-in-pursuit-of-excellence)).

### 2. EFQM Excellence Model

**Enablers and Results Structure:**
The EFQM model divides into two main areas:
- **Enablers** (what an organisation does): Leadership, People, Strategy, Partnerships & Resources, Processes
- **Results** (what an organisation achieves): People Results, Customer Results, Society Results, Key Results

**Fundamental Concepts:**
- Results Orientation
- Customer Focus
- Leadership & Constancy of Purpose
- Management by Processes & Facts
- People Development & Involvement
- Continuous Learning, Innovation & Improvement
- Partnership Development
- Corporate Social Responsibility

**Causal Relationships:**
"The enablers' results causal relation works where leadership leads policy and strategy, people and partnerships and resources, and these four elements influence the results side" ([CIO Wiki](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/EFQM_Excellence_Model)). Results emerge from inputs, and inputs are enhanced by feedback obtained from the results.

**Three Core Questions (2020 EFQM Model):**
- **Why**: Why does this organisation exist? What purpose does it fulfil? Why this particular strategy? (Direction)
- **How**: How does it intend to deliver on its Purpose and Strategy? (Execution)
- **What**: What has it actually achieved to date? What does it intend to achieve tomorrow? (Results)

([Triaster Blog](https://blog.triaster.co.uk/blog/efqm-excellence-model-2020-business-improvement))

**Dynamic Nature:**
"The arrows emphasise the dynamic nature of the Model, showing learning, creativity and innovation helping to improve the Enablers that in turn lead to improved Results" ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326040340_EFQM_EXCELLENCE_MODEL)).

### 3. ISO 9001 Quality Management System

**Process Approach:**
ISO 9001:2015 states: "consistent and predictable results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that function as a coherent system" ([Qualio](https://www.qualio.com/blog/iso-9001-standard)).

**Process Interrelationships:**
- Processes do not operate in isolation but are interrelated and interdependent
- Each process has inputs (from other processes) and outputs (to other processes)
- The output of one process often becomes the input for another
- Understanding these interactions is key to managing efficiency and effectiveness ([ISO 9001 Checklist](https://www.iso-9001-checklist.co.uk/4.4-quality-management-system-and-its-processes.htm))

**Clause 4.4 Requirements:**
Organisations must:
- Determine processes, their sequence, and interaction
- Determine inputs required and outputs expected
- Map out inter-relationships between core processes
- Establish control mechanisms to ensure each step is performed correctly and consistently ([ISMS Online](https://www.isms.online/iso-9001/clause-4-4-quality-management-system-and-its-processes/))

**Seven Quality Management Principles:**
1. Customer Focus
2. Leadership
3. Engagement of People
4. Process Approach
5. Improvement
6. Evidence-Based Decision Making
7. Relationship Management

([ETQ](https://www.etq.com/blog/7-quality-management-principles-under-iso-90012015/))

### 4. Common Criteria Across Business Excellence Models

Research by Talwar (2011b) identified **nine common criteria** across 20 business excellence models:
1. Leadership
2. Strategic Planning
3. People Management
4. Relation with Suppliers/Partners
5. Relation with Customers
6. Information and Knowledge Management
7. Process Management
8. Relation with Society
9. Business Results

([RepEc](https://ideas.repec.org/a/vrs/poicbe/v12y2018i1p966-974n86.html))

**Holistic and Systematic Approach:**
"Business excellence models are frameworks that when applied within an organisation can help to focus thought and action in a more systematic and structured way that should lead to increased performance. The models are holistic in that they focus upon all areas and dimensions of an organisation, and in particular, factors that drive performance" ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233161685_Business_Excellence_Model_An_overarching_framework_for_managing_and_aligning_multiple_organisational_improvement_initiatives)).

- "An organisation can have the most superb strategy, but if its culture is not aligned with and supportive of that strategy, the strategy will either stall or fail" ([PMI](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/aligning-strategy-leadership-culture-8356))
- "Among many explanations for the failure of implementation and execution, one clear reason is the leadership itself. The role of a leader is critical in implementing strategy. Without good leadership, a good strategy cannot happen" ([Strategy Institute](https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/finding-fault-lines-why-leaders-fail-to-execute-business-strategy))

**Strategy Cascade:**
Most organisations' strategies follow common layers:
1. **Corporate** (Vision and long-term objectives)
2. **Business Units** (Regional or divisional priorities)
3. **Departments** (Functional initiatives)
4. **Teams** (Tactical deliverables)

([ClearPoint Strategy](https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/what-is-a-cascading-strategy-steps-for-strategic-alignment))

When these two groups share the same vision and work together to quantify marketing's contribution to the business, the company has a greater chance of accelerating growth" ([GainTheory](https://gaintheory.com/marketing-roi-alliance-with-finance/)).

**Key Metrics:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): "Customer acquisition cost is a metric that is critical for both departments [marketing and finance]" ([ABA Banking Journal](https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2023/04/marketing-and-finance-bridging-the-gap/))
- LTV to CAC Ratios: A 3:1 ratio is considered very good; higher than 3:1 indicates untapped growth potential ([Kitces](https://www.kitces.com/blog/client-acquisition-cost-financial-advisor-marketing-efficiency-lifetime-client-value-lead-generation-satisfaction/))

**Strategic Cascade:**
"Strategic alignment bridges the gap by connecting your organisation's overarching strategy with its ground-level execution. Strategic alignment ensures that an organisation's mission, vision, and strategic objectives guide all efforts across teams and departments" ([ThoughtExchange](https://thoughtexchange.com/blog/strategic-alignment/)).

---

## Root Cause Analysis Patterns

### Framework for Understanding Symptoms and Root Causes

**Root Cause Analysis Definition:**
"Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic examination of a problem or situation that focuses on the problem's origin as the proper point of correction rather than dealing only with its effects" ([ASQ](https://asq.org/quality-resources/root-cause-analysis)).

**Critical Principle:**
85% of executives believe their organisations are bad at diagnosing problems, and 87% think that flaw carries significant costs. "Instinctually, most leaders go straight to solutions. A core idea is you must do a thorough diagnosis first, determine the root causes of your gap, and only then can you move to an integrated intervention based on this diagnosis" ([HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/root-cause-analysis)).

### Pattern 1: Staff Not Performing

**Symptom Location:** People

**Potential Root Causes Across Elements:**

**Strategy:**
- Unclear strategic direction → employees don't understand priorities
- Strategy not communicated or cascaded to frontline
- Strategy-culture misalignment
- Citation: "An MIT Sloan School survey of more than 4,000 managers found that only 28% could correctly list three of their firms' top strategic priorities" ([PMI](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/strategic-alignment-connecting-between-strategy-execution-5962))

**Governance:**
- No position descriptions or role clarity

**Process:**
- Burdensome administrative processes consume productive time
- Inefficient workflows create frustration

- Citation: "When analysing the reasons behind transformation failures, what might be assumed to be the usual suspects—inadequate resources, poor planning, bad ideas, or chance events—turned out to account for less than a third of cases. The vast majority, more than 70 percent, were caused by factors related to organisational health" ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/organizational-health-is-still-the-key-to-long-term-performance))

## Diagnostic Questioning Framework

### Principles for Effective Diagnosis

**1. Start with Symptoms, Probe for Root Causes**
"The 5 Whys approach sequentially probes with 'why' questions to follow explanatory chains probing closer to root causes" ([Strategic Planning with RCA](https://www.anythingresearch.com/Strategic-Planning/Root-Cause-Analysis.htm)).

**2. Look Across Element Boundaries**
"A diversity of root cause analysis tools can methodically assess hypotheses on factor interdependencies. Beyond naming factors, RCA analysis seeks to assess interrelationships—which elements potentially influence other elements either directly or in relayed sequences" ([Strategic Planning with RCA](https://www.anythingresearch.com/Strategic-Planning/Root-Cause-Analysis.htm)).

**3. Consider Hierarchical Dependencies**
Start by examining foundational elements (Governance, Purpose, Strategy) before execution elements (Process, Technology, People).

**4. Map Process Interactions**
"There's always an element of interaction between different processes which you can attribute to inputs and outputs. So, one process's output is another's input" ([ATO Blog](https://blog.auditortrainingonline.com/blog/explaining-iso-9001-clause-4.4-quality-management-system-part-one)).

### Diagnostic Question Sets by Element

9. Do employees have the tools, resources, and authority they need?
10. What is our approach to change management and how effective is it?

**Follow-up probes using McKinsey's three gaps:**
- **Skill gap**: "Do people have the capabilities needed to succeed in this role?"
- **Will gap**: "Are people engaged and energised by the work?"
- **Time gap**: "Are people spending time on high-value activities, or are low-value meetings and poor prioritisation consuming their time?"

([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/want-to-break-the-productivity-ceiling-rethink-the-way-work-gets-done))

**Culture alignment probe:**
- "Is our culture dependent, independent, or interdependent, and does that align with our strategy?" ([CCL](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/whats-your-leadership-culture/))

#### PROCESS Diagnostic Questions

**When to explore Process as potential root cause:**

- "What are the sequence and interaction of processes affecting [problem area]?"
- "Are process inputs and outputs clearly defined and controlled?"
- "How do we ensure processes are performed correctly and consistently?"

([ISO 9001 Checklist](https://www.iso-9001-checklist.co.uk/4.4-quality-management-system-and-its-processes.htm))

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Is this process designed efficiently or has it evolved organically?"
- "Where does one process's output become another's input, and is that handoff effective?"
- "Are we automating a broken process or fixing the process first?"

#### TECHNOLOGY Diagnostic Questions

**When to explore Technology as potential root cause:**
- Process inefficiencies that could be automated
- Poor data visibility or reporting
- Customer experience issues

- "What 97% of IT managers recognise: is process automation necessary for our digital transformation in this area?" ([Nintex](https://www.nintex.com/blog/digital-transformation-starts-with-line-of-business-process-automation/))
- "Is the technology problem really a people adoption problem?"
- "Are we investing in technology aligned with our strategic priorities?"

### Comprehensive Diagnostic Sequence

When investigating any organisational problem, use this sequence:

**Step 1: Define the Symptom Clearly**
- What is the observable problem?
- Where is it showing up (which element)?
- What is the impact (quantified where possible)?
- How long has it been occurring?

**Step 2: Check Foundational Elements First**

Start with Governance:
- "Is there adequate governance oversight of this area?"
- "Are roles and accountabilities clear?"

Then Purpose:
- "Does the problem indicate purpose drift or misalignment?"

Then Strategy:
- "Is there a clear strategy for this area?"
- "Is strategy being executed effectively?"

**Step 3: Explore Execution Element Interactions**

Map the process:
- "What processes are involved?"
- "How do these processes interact?"
- "Where are the inputs/outputs/handoffs?"

Assess people factors:
- "Do people have skills, will, and time?" (McKinsey's three gaps)
- "Is leadership effective?"

Check technology enablement:
- "Is technology supporting or hindering?"

Examine marketing-finance interaction:
- "Is there alignment between customer acquisition and financial sustainability?"

**Step 4: Review Performance/Measurement**
- "What metrics would have revealed this earlier?"
- "Are there feedback loops for continuous improvement?"

**Step 5: Apply the 5 Whys Across Elements**

Example for "Cash flow problems":
1. Why do we have cash flow problems? → Customers are paying slowly
2. Why are customers paying slowly? → Invoicing is delayed
3. Why is invoicing delayed? → Manual process takes time
4. Why is the process manual? → No technology investment
5. Why was there no technology investment? → Not prioritised in strategy

This traces from Finance (symptom) → Process → Technology → Strategy (root cause).

**Step 6: Use Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram**

Organise potential root causes under element categories:

```
                                    PROBLEM
                                       ↑
    Governance          Purpose        |        Strategy
         ↘                ↓            |            ↓
          ─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────
         ↗                ↑            |            ↑
    People             Process         |      Technology
                                       ↑
                                   Marketing
                                   Finance
                                   Performance
```

For each element, ask the diagnostic questions specific to that element.

## Practical Application Guidelines

### For Chatbot Implementation

#### 1. Symptom Recognition Patterns

When a user describes a problem, the chatbot should:

**a) Identify the primary element where the symptom appears:**

Use these trigger phrases:

| Element | Symptom Triggers |
|---------|------------------|
| Governance | "no accountability", "unclear authority", "lack of oversight", "inconsistent decisions" |
| Purpose | "unclear why we exist", "lack of alignment", "competing values", "purpose drift" |
| Strategy | "don't know priorities", "strategy not executed", "unclear direction", "misalignment" |
| Marketing | "customer complaints", "can't acquire customers", "losing customers", "pricing issues" |
| Finance | "cash flow problems", "can't fund initiatives", "cost overruns", "profitability issues" |
| Performance | "don't measure results", "no visibility", "can't track progress", "no accountability for outcomes" |
| People | "employees not performing", "high turnover", "low engagement", "skill gaps", "resistance to change" |
| Process | "inefficiencies", "rework", "bottlenecks", "waste", "inconsistent quality" |
| Technology | "manual processes", "system failures", "data silos", "poor user experience" |

**b) Acknowledge the symptom and signal intention to explore root causes:**

Template: "I understand you're experiencing [symptom] in [element]. This symptom can often have root causes in multiple areas. Let's explore the underlying factors systematically."

#### 2. Diagnostic Questioning Strategy

**a) Start broad, then narrow:**

"Let's start with some fundamental questions about your organisation's foundation, then we'll explore specific areas."

**b) Use the hierarchical approach:**

Tier 1 (Foundational):
- "First, let's check governance and purpose..."

Tier 2 (Strategic):
- "Now let's examine your strategy..."

Tier 3 (Execution):
- "Let's look at how this is being executed through your people, processes, and technology..."

Tier 4 (Measurement):
- "How are you measuring and monitoring this area?"

**c) Apply element-specific question sets**

Based on the diagnostic question framework above, select 3-5 most relevant questions for each element explored.

**d) Look for interdependencies**

After exploring each element, ask:
- "How does [Element A] interact with [Element B] in this situation?"
- "When [Element A] has this problem, what effect does it have on [Element B]?"

Example:
User: "Our cash flow is terrible."
Bot: "I understand you're experiencing cash flow problems. Let's explore the root causes systematically.

First, let's look at your customer acquisition and retention (Marketing):
1. What types of customers are you acquiring?
2. What is your average collection period?

Now let's examine your processes:
3. How quickly do you invoice after delivery?
4. What is your collections process?

And your strategy:
5. Is your pricing strategy designed to optimise cash flow or market share?

These areas often interact to create cash flow issues."

#### 3. Root Cause Hypothesis Formation

After gathering diagnostic information, the chatbot should:

**a) Synthesise findings across elements:**

"Based on what you've shared, I'm seeing potential root causes in [Element 1], [Element 2], and [Element 3]."

**b) Explain the interdependencies:**

"Here's how these elements are connected in your situation:
- [Element 1 issue] is affecting [Element 2] by [mechanism]
- This is then impacting [Element 3] because [reason]
- The result is the symptom you're experiencing in [Element X]"

**c) Prioritise by hierarchical position:**

"Of these potential root causes, I'd recommend addressing [Foundational Element] first because it's foundational to the others. Fixing [Execution Element] without addressing [Strategic Element] will likely result in recurrence."

#### 4. Recommendation Framework

Structure recommendations using this hierarchy:

**Immediate (Symptomatic Relief):**
"In the short term, to relieve the immediate symptom in [Element], consider [tactical action]."

**Intermediate (Execution Fixes):**
"To address the execution-level root causes in [Process/People/Technology], implement [specific improvements]."

**Strategic (Foundational Fixes):**
"For sustainable resolution, address the foundational root causes in [Governance/Purpose/Strategy] by [strategic actions]."

**Example:**
Problem: Staff not performing

Recommendations:
- **Immediate**: Provide additional training on [specific skill gap] (People)
- **Intermediate**: Redesign the [burdensome process] to reduce administrative load (Process)
- **Strategic**: Clarify and cascade strategic priorities so employees understand direction (Strategy), and implement performance KPIs with accountability framework (Governance)

#### 5. Feedback Loop Integration

After recommendations:

**a) Define success metrics:**
"To know if these interventions are working, you should measure:
- [Leading indicator in Element X]
- [Lagging indicator in Element Y]
- [Process metric in Element Z]"

**b) Establish review cadence:**
"Review these metrics [frequency] and adjust your approach based on what you learn."

**c) Encourage continuous improvement:**
"This follows the Baldrige ADLI methodology: Approach (what you'll do), Deployment (how you'll implement), Learning (measuring results), Integration (embedding improvements)."

### Example Diagnostic Conversation Flow

**User:** "Our employees aren't performing well."

**Bot:** "I understand you're experiencing employee performance issues. This symptom can have root causes across multiple areas of your organisation. Let me ask some diagnostic questions to identify the underlying factors.

**Governance & Clarity:**
1. Do employees have clear position descriptions and understand their responsibilities?
2. Are there performance KPIs and accountability frameworks in place?

**Strategy Alignment:**
3. Can employees articulate your top 3 strategic priorities?
4. Do they understand how their work contributes to strategy?

**Process & Systems:**
5. What percentage of their time is spent on value-adding work vs. administrative tasks?
6. Are there frustrating or inefficient processes they must navigate?

**People Factors:**
7. Have they received adequate training for their roles?
8. How would you describe leadership and management quality?

**Technology:**
9. Do they have the technology tools they need to be productive?

Please share what you know about these areas, and we'll identify where the root causes likely lie."

**User:** "Most employees can't name our strategic priorities. They spend a lot of time in low-value meetings. We haven't updated our processes in years, and they're very manual."

**Bot:** "Thank you. I'm seeing a pattern here that points to root causes in multiple elements:

**Primary Root Causes:**
1. **Strategy (Tier 2 - Foundational)**: Your strategic priorities haven't been effectively cascaded. Research shows only 28% of managers can correctly list their firms' top three strategic priorities—this is a common but critical gap.

2. **Process (Tier 3 - Execution)**: Outdated, manual processes are creating what McKinsey calls 'the time gap'—employees spending time on low-value activities instead of strategic work.

**How These Interact:**
- Unclear strategy → employees don't know what to prioritise
- Time consumed by inefficient processes → even less time for strategic thinking
- Result → overall poor performance

**Recommendations:**

**Strategic (Priority 1 - Address First):**
- Clarify your top 3-5 strategic priorities
- Cascade these through the organisation using the strategy cascade model: Corporate → Business Unit → Department → Team levels
- Ensure every employee can articulate how their role contributes to at least one strategic priority

**Execution (Priority 2 - After Strategy is Clear):**
- Map your core processes and identify the most time-consuming, low-value activities
- Redesign or eliminate these processes before considering technology automation
- Consider whether technology could enable process efficiency (but fix the process first)

**Measurement (Ongoing):**
- Measure: % of employees who can articulate strategic priorities (target: >80%)
- Measure: % of employee time spent on strategic vs. administrative work
- Track employee engagement and performance metrics to see improvement

This approach addresses the root causes at the foundational and execution levels, rather than just treating the symptom with more training or performance management."
